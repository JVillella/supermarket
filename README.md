# Supermarket

This is a thin JRuby wrapper for the [Android Market API](http://code.google.com/p/android-market-api/) Java project (also mirrored on github: [jberkel/android-market-api](http://github.com/jberkel/android-market-api/)).

It's a new project and only some parts of the protocol have been implemented. I decided to build on top of Java/JRuby because the native Ruby Protocolbuffer implementation ([ruby-protobuf](http://code.google.com/p/ruby-protobuf/)) could not properly handle the [.proto file](http://github.com/jberkel/android-market-api/blob/master/AndroidMarketApi/proto/market.proto) used by the API.

## Synopsis

```ruby
require 'supermarket'
session = Supermarket::Session.new

# search apps for term 'foo' return results as json
puts session.search("foo").to_json

# retrieve comments for an app by app id as xml
puts session.comments("com.example.my.project").to_xml
```

## Installation

```ruby
$ gem install supermarket
```

You will need to provide your Google market credentials in ~/.supermarket.yml:

```yml
login: foo@gmail.com
password: secret
```

## Command line usage

### Searching

```
$ market search ruboto | jsonpretty

{
  "app": [
    {
      "rating": "4.642857142857143",
      "title": "Ruboto IRB",
      "ratingsCount": 14,
      "creator": "Jan Berkel",
      "appType": "APPLICATION",
      "id": "9089465703133677000",
      "packageName": "org.jruby.ruboto.irb",
      "version": "0.1",
      "versionCode": 1,
      "creatorId": "\"Jan Berkel\"",
      "ExtendedInfo": {
        "category": "Tools",
        "permissionId": [
...

```

### Comments

```
$ market comments org.jruby.ruboto.irb | jsonpretty

{
  "comments": [
    {
      "rating": 5,
      "creationTime": 1269710736815,
      "authorName": "Nate Kidwell",
      "text": "Tremendous application. More examples would be great (as would integrated rubydocs), but awesome all the same.",
      "authorId": "04441815096871118032"
    },
...
```

### Screenshot

```
$ market imagedata org.jruby.ruboto.irb --image-out=image.jpg
```

### Google spreadsheet import

Import `market_comments_template.csv` into a new spreadsheet, with CSV
conversion. Open the imported document, rename as you like. In the menu, click
on `Forms / Create form`. Add anything in the form description just to enable
the Save button. If you are using a private Google Apps domain, make sure to
uncheck the option "Require yourdomain.com sign-in to view this form." Save the
form. Copy the formkey displayed in the link at the bottom of the form creation
page

Run:

```
    comments2form app_id form_key
```

The initial import of comments will take a while, but subsequent runs will only
add new comments to the form. Just stick the command in a crontab somewhere.

## Credits

This library would be impossible without the code from the [Android Market API](http://code.google.com/p/android-market-api/) project. Serialization support handled by the [protobuf-java-format](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-java-format/) library.
